## How to Install the Project

To install the project's CLI, we recommend using `pipx` for this installation:

```bash
pipx install musical-notes
```

Although this is only a recommendation! You can also install the project with your preferred package manager, such as `pip`:
```bash
pip install musical-notes
```
